For Wedge steps:

Main questions( in GPT ): What is the acceleration of the block ?

subquestion: Whats the acceleration of block in terms of acceleration of wedge ?

Before Question - Jab bhi hum kisi object jo ki movable wedge pe hai, ka acceleration likhte hain, to hum uska acceleration 
likhne ke liye wedge constraint lagate hain jiska simple matlab hai ki acceleration of the object is acceleration of object wrt wedge 
plus acceleration of wedge wrt ground. To acceleration ki equation kya hogi ? 

Answer = ( if acceleration of wedge is a4 and acceleration of block wrt wedge is a1 )
a1 ( up the incline ) + a4 ( right ) 

After Question - Well done. Ab hum iss acceleration ko up the incline and perpendicular to the incline resolve karenge. 


Next subquestion: Whats the accelration resolution up and perpendicular to the incline ?
Before Question - A1 ka component to poora poora along the incline hai, a4 ko resolve kariye bass. 
Answer: a1 + a4 cos( theta )  

Main Question( in GPT ) - Whats the F=ma equation of the red block ?

subquestion: How many cuts on the imaginary sphere ?

Before question: F=ma equation lagane k liye hume block pe forces nikaalna hai. Gola banake dekhiye kahan string ko 
cut kar raha hai aur block kitni surfaces touch kar raha hai. To bataiye kitni jageh cut hai ?

After: well done

subquestion: iss cut pe kya force hai ?

...
...

Subquestion: Ab bataiye jitni jageh cuts hain ?

....
....

subquestion: iss touch k karan kya force ayega

subquestion: What are the forces on the block along and perp to incline ?

Before: T poora poora along the incline hai aur N poora poora perp to incline hai - bass mg ko resolve karna hai 
After: Humne acceleration aur forces likh liya hai. Ab bass F= ma lagan hai 


Subquestion: Apply F=ma along and perp to incline
